By severity:

* Moderate:
    * HTTP compliance:
        * Transfer-Encoding:chunked
        * multipart
    * Relevant syntax error messages (for EVERY. SINGLE. STATE. IN. THE. FSM.) - these would be based on the final state in the FSM
    * 
* Low:
    * HTTP compliance:
        * clientside caching (If-Modified-Since)
    * Python:
        * standard library maybe?
