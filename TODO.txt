By severity:

* MVC:
<#insert filename #>: early include - optional
<#embed filename #>: late include
<%view view_name %vm python code %>

* !!compile exec scripts!
* !!set eval() filename to be more descriptive (better than <string>); maybe find a way to get python script line number/at least idx?

* Moderate:
    * HTTP compliance:
        * Transfer-Encoding:chunked
    * Relevant syntax error messages (for EVERY. SINGLE. STATE. IN. THE. FSM.) - these would be based on the final state in the FSM
* Low:
    * Python:
        * standard library maybe?
